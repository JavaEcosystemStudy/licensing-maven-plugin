Your situation is that you work at a company and you'd like to keep an eye on which projects depend on which dependencies.  You *could* do it in a repository manager or some such, but the truth is, some projects you have may have different needs.

This licensing plugin works off zero or more *licensing-requirements.xml* files (named as you like) found in its classpath (which means you can include it as a dependency).

When you run *licensing:check*, it ensures that:

# all your dependencies have licenses.
# all your dependencies are licensed in at least one liked license.

Often, something goes wrong so the *licensing-requirements.xml* comes in handy.

In that file you can specify the license for artifacts (GAV) which are missing licenses.  You also list which licenses you dislike (we blacklist).

Two other things go in that file.  First, you can coalesce license names and you can mark certain artifacts as being exempt from being disliked.
